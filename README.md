# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains Python-based data analysis projects developed using Jupyter Notebook. The work focuses on processing structured datasets, extracting insights, and visualizing results through programmatic analysis.

## Overview
These projects were completed to strengthen data manipulation, analytical reasoning, and backend-style data processing skills. The analyses emphasize repeatable logic and clear interpretation of results.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Filtering, aggregation, and transformation of structured data
- Statistical analysis and insight generation
- Visualization of trends and results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data analysis libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib)

## Concepts Applied
- Data-driven reasoning
- Structured data processing
- Analytical problem solving
- Backend-style data pipelines

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file:
   PaytonD_Data.ipynb
2. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
